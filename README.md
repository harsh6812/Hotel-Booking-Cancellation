# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction - Capstone Project
"Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction: A data-driven capstone project deploying machine learning to empower hotels in making informed decisions, optimizing resources, and enhancing customer satisfaction. Predictive models and actionable insights revolutionize reservation management, addressing revenue loss and operational inefficiencies.

### Introduction
This capstone project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations using advanced machine learning techniques. The objective is to empower hotels to make informed decisions, optimize resource utilization, and revolutionize reservation management strategies.

### Methodology
Utilizing machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression and decision trees, the project analyzes historical booking data and predicts cancellations. Model interpretability is prioritized, allowing hotel management to understand reasons behind cancellations and implement proactive strategies.

### Business Problem Statement
The inability to accurately predict booking cancellations impacts revenue and operational efficiency. This project addresses the challenge by developing a predictive model, providing actionable insights for proactive cancellation management, revenue optimization, and improved operational efficiency.

### Business Objectives
Optimizing Resource Allocation: Improve staff management efficiency by predicting cancellations. Revenue Maximization: Implement proactive overbooking strategies based on accurate predictions. Data-Driven Decision Making: Foster a culture of data-driven decision-making with predictive analytics. Enhancing Customer Experience: Implement personalized services for guests likely to cancel, improving overall satisfaction.

### Dataset Information
The dataset, available on Kaggle, contains 32 attributes with 119,390 observations. Key predicting variables include 'reserved_room_type,' 'assigned_room_type,' and 'booking_changes,' with 'is_cancelled' as the response variable.

### Approach
The approach involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, deployment, and ongoing monitoring. The model integrates with inventory management systems, providing real-time insights and recommendations to hotels.

### Target Variable
The target variable is 'is_cancelled,' predicting whether a booking will be canceled. The dataset exhibits a balanced distribution, with 63% not canceled and 37% canceled bookings.# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation
